How to create an app mostly application and I want the front end to be in the react and maybe the backend to either Python and also a database also to be there mostly no sequel database. I'm preferring now the requirement is I want to work on some generally I a single manager who works on different directories whenever I get the RFP I'll need to work on estimating the effort for the front end so the one that I'm trying to build is mostly for capturing the front and estimations so what I am, envisioning is more like it to have multiple sections like one common section with user set up required and also what are the different basic things that I should be considering as part of the front and building like a court coverages are what CSS processor accessibility performance security all these aspects to be considered as part of while I missed meeting that airport and also there should be a provision for adding the different features because that they are very specific to the project requirement and also giving the destinations for giving the estimation what I'm thinking is to follow the T-shirt sizing and also to give the multiplayer for each T-shirt size and say maybe one requirement might be th XL is the T-shirt size and three times of the X is what I'm thinking at the end I mean, it should give me how much of it could take for the app for designing the entire app. Just give me the starting code base and I want you to deploy. Also, this app I mean, I want your help to complete into development and deployment maybe to the next half an hour like that.
